                    <h2>Blurryface was well-received by critics, who complimented its themes and musical diversity. <br> It is considered to be the band's breakthrough album, becoming their first and only release to date to reach number one on the Billboard 200. The album sold over 1.5 million copies in the United States as of April 2017. <br> In 2018, Blurryface became the first album in the digital era to have every track receive at least a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. <br> On May 15, 2019, it reached the milestone of being on the Billboard 200 chart for four consecutive years, never leaving the chart up until that point. It is also the most-streamed rock album in history.

                    <h2>OK Computer is the third studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 21 May 1997. With their producer, Nigel Godrich, Radiohead recorded most of OK Computer in their rehearsal space in Oxfordshire and the historic mansion of St Catherine's Court in Bath in 1996 and early 1997. <br> 
                        They distanced themselves from the guitar-centred, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, The Bends. <br> OK Computer's abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and eclectic influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work. </h2>
